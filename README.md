# sedfitting-phrds
Software package for constraining young stellar properties from infrared SED fitting (Povich et al. 2019)

This package currently consists of a custom IDL library (I know, I'm a dinosaur!) and set of data analysis recipes that combine this library with the Python implementation of Tom Robitaille's [sedfitter](https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter). 

The IDL library has been verified using IDL 8.7.1 and requires the [IDL Astronomy User's Library](https://github.com/wlandsman/IDLAstro) and [idl-coyote library](https://github.com/idl-coyote/coyote).
